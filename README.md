# Segmentation Tree for Dynamic Operations

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Segmentation Tree (segtree) designed to handle dynamic sequences of operations efficiently, particularly for pre-colored graphs.

## Overview

The Segmentation Tree structure is optimized for operations involving pre-colored graphs. It divides the graph into segments, allowing quick traversal and manipulation of color-based data.

### Usage

Instances are read from standard input, defining the number of time instances and operations. Operations include updates and queries, enabling alterations and retrievals based on graph coloring.

### Implementation

The code comprises functions for building the Segmentation Tree, executing queries, and performing updates. Detailed implementation guidance is provided within the codebase.
